\section{Introduction}

About the problem.



\section{State-of-the-art}

Describe what others have done, citing their works. There are different formats: a paper as \cite{uncu2007}, a book as \cite{hosmer-lemeshow2000}, or a book chapter as \cite{wold75} or as in the proceedings of a conference (\cite{shakhnarovich2001icml}).

    \subsection{More specific}


Perhaps some subsections are needed.

\section{Conclusions and future research}

What are the main open lines for research.
